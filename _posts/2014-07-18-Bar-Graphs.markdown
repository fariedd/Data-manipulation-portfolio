**Figure 1:** This stacked bar graph visualises the annual relative contributions by mass of the dominant prey species in the diets of Macaroni (a) and Eastern Rockhopper (b) penguins over the last 25 years breeding at Marion Island (no data were gathered
for eastern rockhopper penguins in 2002). *Plotted using ggplot2*

**Figure 2:** This project used citizen science data collected by observers on boat vessels (line transect counts of seabirds at sea). The stacked bar graph shows the one degree latitudinal spatial density of the 10 numerically abundant seabird species, dashed lines showing latitudinal average position of Subtropical Front (STC), Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF) and Antarctic Polar Front (APF), from left to right resctively. *Plotted using ggplot2, R*

**Figure 3:** The project used client data provided by an electricity and gas company to evaluate business growth. The stacked bar graph shows customer churn(the percentage of customers that stopped using their company's product or service during a certain time frame). *Plotted using seaborn, Python*

**Figure 4:** This project used TDR GPS tracking data of tagged African penguins on Dassen Island (red dot). The graph shows the movement of the penguins around the island (left). The tags measure temperature and the graph infers temperature distribution preferred by African Penguins.

**Figure 5:** The project used diet data of Cape fur Seal collected along the northern, western and eastern coast of South Africa against the fish biomas of all vessels reported. The graph shows the annual percentage composition of Anchovy and Sardine in the diet of sampled seals against the biomass of Anchovy and Sardine caught by vessels.
